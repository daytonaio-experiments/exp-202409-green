### AI-Powered Documentation and Changelog Generator

**Job to be Done:**

**When** developers and development teams need to keep documentation, changelogs, and commit histories up-to-date and easily accessible,

**We want to** extend the existing "Intelligent Code Base Embedding and Query System" to generate and maintain documentation, changelogs, and release notes by analyzing the entire codebase and commit history from a GitHub repository.

**So that** developers can automatically keep their documentation and changelogs current, enhancing project transparency and reducing manual documentation overhead.

### Objectives

1. **Commit Chunking:** Develop a strategy for breaking down commit histories into manageable chunks suitable for embedding.
2. **Commit Embedding Generation:** Utilize the existing embedding model and infrastructure to generate embeddings for commit history chunks.
3. **Document Generation:** Implement an AI system to generate and update documentation, changelogs, and release notes based on the code and commit embeddings.
4. **Search and Query Extension:** Extend the existing search and query system to include documentation and change logs.
5. **API Extension:** Extend the existing API to expose functionalities for generating and retrieving documentation, changelogs, and release notes.

### High-Level Functional Specification for AI-Powered Documentation and Changelog Generator

#### Overview
This document outlines the functional specification for an AI-driven system that extends the existing "Intelligent Code Base Embedding and Query System" to generate and maintain documentation, changelogs, and release notes for entire codebases and commit histories from GitHub repositories. This system leverages the existing vector database and embedding infrastructure to allow developers to efficiently generate, search, and understand documentation and change logs.

#### Functional Requirements

**1. Commit Chunking**
- **Chunking Strategy:**
  - Develop a strategy for breaking down commit histories into meaningful chunks, such as by individual commits or grouped by feature branches.
  - Ensure chunks are semantically meaningful to preserve context, such as commit messages and related code changes within the same chunk.
- **Chunking Implementation:**
  - Implement commit chunking using a scripting language like Python to preprocess the commit history.
  - Store metadata about each chunk, including commit ID, commit message, and related code changes.

**2. Commit Embedding Generation**
- **Embedding Process:**
  - Utilize the existing embedding pipeline to generate embeddings for each chunk of commit history.
  - Ensure embeddings are generated quickly to handle extensive commit histories.

**3. Document Generation**
- **Documentation Generation:**
  - Develop an AI system to analyze code and commit embeddings to generate and update documentation for code functions, classes, modules, and overall architecture.
  - Utilize the existing code embeddings to provide context and generate accurate documentation.
- **Changelog Generation:**
  - Implement a system to generate changelogs by analyzing commit embeddings, grouping by feature or bugfix, and summarizing changes.
- **Release Notes Generation:**
  - Develop a pipeline to generate release notes based on major changes extracted from the commit history embeddings.
  
**4. Search and Query Extension**
- **Search Implementation:**
  - Extend the existing search system to include documentation and change logs.
  - Implement a frontend for developers to input search queries and view results for both code and documentation.
- **Query Optimization:**
  - Optimize the search queries for speed and accuracy, leveraging the existing nearest neighbor algorithms.
  - Implement filters to narrow down search results based on documentation type, changelog version, or other metadata.

**5. API Extension**
- **API Development:**
  - Extend the existing RESTful API to expose functionalities for generating and retrieving documentation, changelogs, and release notes.
  - Design endpoints for key operations such as generating documentation, fetching changelogs or release notes, and searching for specific documentation.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the existing API documentation to include the new functionalities and endpoints related to documentation and change logs.
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Conduct integration testing to ensure the extended API works seamlessly with the existing system and other tools used by developers.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:**
  - Ensure the extended system can handle large codebases with millions of lines of code and extensive commit histories.
- **Performance:**
  - Optimize document generation and search queries to return results quickly.
- **Usability:**
  - Provide a user-friendly interface for searching and querying documentation and changelogs.
- **Reliability:**
  - Ensure high accuracy in document generation and search results.
- **Maintainability:**
  - Implement modular and maintainable code to facilitate future enhancements and updates.
  
#### Deployment and Integration (Optional)
- **Integration:**
  - Seamlessly integrate the extended documentation and changelog generation system with the existing Daytona CLI and workflows.
- **Deployment:**
  - Deploy the extended solution within the existing infrastructure, supporting both cloud-based and local environments.

#### Future Enhancements
- **Interactive Documentation Customization:**
  - Allow users to interactively refine and customize their documentation and changelog generation processes.
- **Continuous Learning:**
  - Track and log interactions to improve the system's accuracy and efficiency over time.
- **Multimodal Embeddings:**
  - Explore the use of multimodal embeddings that combine code with other relevant data, such as documentation, commit history, and issue tracking, for enhanced document generation capabilities.

By extending the existing "Intelligent Code Base Embedding and Query System" with AI-powered documentation and changelog generation capabilities, Daytona users will be empowered to efficiently maintain up-to-date documentation and changelogs, boosting productivity and collaboration significantly. The extension of the existing RESTful API will further enhance the system's utility by allowing seamless integration with other tools and workflows, ensuring comprehensive and accessible project documentation.
